# JSON_TakeHome
Project where I was given just a JSON File to create a site.

This is vanilla js, utilized bootstrap for css properties.  This is my first time really working with JSON, I have also not used jQuery.  This code could be much shorter, but just getting the data onto my index page was a great learning experience.  Given some more time, I think I would really commit to some good CSS to really organize the data within a good grid layout, I was more concerned with getting the data, although I couldn't quite figure out how to get video over to my html even though I was able to with my images, I'm sure I missed something rather minor.
